# C-Exploits
These are some exploits I wrote to grant an unprivileged user a root shell while taking an Introduction to Cybersecurity course at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The exploits take advantage of a buggy version control program written in C, and they were performed inside a QEMU virtual machine. All the necessary documentation and code is provided to download and run these exploits on your own machine.
