Sploit3 is almost an exact copy of Sploit2, except it exploits the execlp command on line 204, where it calls the chmod. See readme2.txt for a more detailed explanation. The only difference between the two is that the malicious c program is called "chmod" instead of "chown", which forces the exec call on line 204 to call our malicious chmod program instead of the actual one after modifying the $PATH variable.
